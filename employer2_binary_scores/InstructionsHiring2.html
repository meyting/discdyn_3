<h5> Your Task: </h5>
<p>
    <b>As in part I, on the following pages, you will again be asked to make a series of {{C.number_of_pairs}} selection decisions. In each decision you
    will be presented with two `workers' and asked to select one of them.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The workers are participants of another study in which they have performed a task, that determines your bonus payment.
    You will be provided with a piece of information about each workers' performance in this task.</p>
<p>
    The task that the workers have performed measures their logical reasoning ability.
    In particular, they had {{C.time_limit_sequences}} minutes to solve as many number sequences as possible.
    In order to solve a sequence, they needed to find the missing number of the respective sequence, by detecting the pattern according to which the sequence is constructed (see example below).
</p>
<p style="background-color:#edeef0; padding:10px;  border-radius: 15px;">
<u> Example of the Worker's Task: </u> <br><br>
<img style="margin-left:5%", class="logo" src="{% static 'example_sequences.png' %}" alt="Example Task Workers">
<br><br>

        In this example, the rule according to which the sequence of numbers is constructed is to subtract 1 from the previous number in the sequence.
        Therefore, the correct answer would be "5". The workers could always skip a sequence by clicking on "Next".

</p>
<p>
    The total number of solved sequences determined a workers 'score'.
    The workers were incentivized by being paid according to their score, i.e. the higher a worker's score, the higher the worker's payment.
</p>


    <!--  // <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>

<table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ,  </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
-->


<h5> Your Bonus Payment: </h5>
<p>
    One of the {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}} selection decisions will be randomly drawn as the decision-that-counts. If you have chosen the worker
    with the higher score in that decision, you get {{C.bonushiring}}, otherwise you get no bonus payment. <br>
</p>
<p>
    For each selection decision, we provide you with information about the workers' gender, age, race and a hint about the workers' scores.
</p>
<p>
    Please click 'Next' if you have read and understood the explanations. On the next page, you will be presented with the first pair of workers.
